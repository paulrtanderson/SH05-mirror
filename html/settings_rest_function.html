        <p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
        <p>Through the pop-up accessed by clicking the extension in your browser extension menu, you can access the different features by clicking the arrow buttons.</p>
        <p>The extension indexes automatically. To search your indexed content, type "@@" in the browser omnibar, then press Tab and enter your search query.</p>
        <p><strong>To-do list</strong></p>
        <p>Press the green "+" button to add a new task. You can change the title, description, due date and time, as well as create tags to add to your task here. If you want to add a specific colour to your new tag, you can do so by writing the hex code for the colour in the text box underneath the default colour options.</p>
        <p>The yellow icon next to the new task button brings up your recently deleted tasks. These are stored for 30 days after deletion.</p>
